      type: string
    - name: count
      description: The number of candlesticks to return in the reponse. Count should not be specified if both the start and end parameters are provided, as the time range combined with the graularity will determine the number of candlesticks to return.

      type: integer
    - name: from
      description: The start of the time range to fetch candlesticks for.
      in: query

    - name: smooth
      description: A flag that controls whether the candlestick is "smoothed" or not.  A smoothed candlestick uses the previous candle's close price as its open price, while an unsmoothed candlestick uses the first price from its time range as its open price.
      in: query
      type: boolean
    - name: includeFirst
      description: A flag that controls whether the candlestick that is covered by the from time should be included in the results. This flag enables clients to use the timestamp of the last completed candlestick received to poll for future candlesticks but avoid receiving the previous candlestick repeatedly.
