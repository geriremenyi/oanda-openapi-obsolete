            description: The response body for the Transaction Stream uses chunked transfer encoding.  Each chunk contains Transaction and/or TransactionHeartbeat objects encoded as JSON.  Each JSON object is serialized into a single line of text, and multiple objects found in the same chunk are separated by newlines. TransactionHeartbeats are sent every 5 seconds.
